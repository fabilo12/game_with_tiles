# Game with tiles

This is an implementation of a [known board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azul_(board_game)). It was made as an exercise in order to get practice in JavaScript, React and aspects of front-end development. 

## Playing the game

The game is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under [this Link](https://fabilo12.github.io/game_with_tiles/).

## Todos

* Network mode
  * So far, it is not possible to play on network. That means all players have to play from the same device within the same browser. 
* Look and handling, especially on mobile devices.

## About implementation

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Global state management is done via the Context API as explained in [this blog post](https://codeburst.io/global-state-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-87019cc4f2cf). For the deployment, I followed [these instructions](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).
